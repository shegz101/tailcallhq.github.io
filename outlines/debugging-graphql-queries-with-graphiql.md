# Debugging GraphQl queries with GraphiQL

**Target Audience:** Front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers, API integrators, technical leads, GraphQL beginners, and QA engineers who need to debug and optimise GraphQL queries using GraphiQL.

**Aim:** This article aims to guide developers in effectively debugging GraphQL queries using GraphiQL. It explores key features of GraphiQL for query validation, introspection, and error handling. By improving query efficiency and accuracy, the article seeks to significantly enhance productivity and streamline the debugging process, providing practical examples and tips for mastering GraphQL query debugging with GraphiQL.

## Introduction
GraphiQL is an interactive, in-browser GraphQL IDE that allows developers to test and debug their GraphQL queries. It provides a user-friendly interface to construct queries, view responses, and inspect the underlying GraphQL schema, making it easier to identify and fix issues with GraphQL queries during development.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you need:
- You must be familiar with the GraphiQL interface
- A good understanding of GraphQl queries

## What is Debugging?
- Understanding what debugging is and its importance concerning GraphQL queries
- Why is GraphiQl a good option for debugging GraphQl queries (query validation and error handling)

## Instances that can lead to bugs in the Queries
- Identifying the common errors that can generate bugs in a query. Highlight and explain them.
- The common errors are Syntax, Type Mismatches, and Field Resolution issues.

## Practical Scenario of Debugging a GraphQL Query in GraphiQL
This section will guide you through a practical approach to debugging your GraphQL query using GraphiQL, exploring each pane and segment to aid the debugging process.
- Setting up your GraphQL endpoint in the GraphiQl (add a link to this section in the exploring GraphiQL article). Launch GraphiQl and configure the endpoint.

- Write your query in the Query editor pane
```graphql
# your query
```
- Check for Syntax errors: GraphiQL will automatically validate your query and highlight any syntax errors in red as you type
Example: missing curly braces
```graphql
# code sample with this error
```

- Inspect your Schema: Use the Documentation Explorer pane to understand your schema's available types, fields, and arguments. Click on the types and fields to view their details

- Test with variables: Add variables in the Variables Editor to make your query dynamic.
```graphql
# query showing the variable added
```

- Analysing the response
    -  Inspect the response in the Result Pane to ensure you're getting the expected data
    ```json
    // sample of successful response
    ```

    - Explain an instance where there is an error and how users can use the error messages to identify the issues.
    ```json
    // sample of an error response
    ```

## Best Practices
- Writing clear and well-structured queries. Using modular queries, i.e. breaking down complex queries into smaller and manageable chunks.
- Implement thorough/consistent query testing strategies to detect errors early.
- Adding in-line comments in your Query

## Conclusion.
- Give a summary/recap on the key points discussed
- Add a call to action.
