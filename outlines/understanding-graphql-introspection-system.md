# Understanding GraphQL's Introspection System

## What is GraphQl Introspection?
- Define introspection in the context of GraphQL.
- Explain how introspection helps understand and interact with the API.

## Introspection Queries
- Create an introspection query, then explain each introspection type below
- Standard Introspection types: __type, __schema, __field, __enumvalue, __directive, __inputvalue
[add screenshots of these query types]
[add diagrams showing the relationship between these introspection types]

## Introspection Use cases
- Schemas Visualisation and Validation: Validates schema changes don't break existing queries in CI pipelines
- API Documentation Generation
- Dynamic Query Building
- Query optimisation

## An example of GraphQL Introspection in use
- Here, you will practically explain to readers all that has been discussed
- Querying the __schema field to get available types
[Screenshot of a simple introspection query and its result in GraphiQL.]
- Examining a specific type to get its fields and types
[Screenshot showing the result of querying a specific typeâ€™s fields and types.]
- Accessing type documentation using introspection
[Screenshot an example of auto-generated API documentation using introspection data.]

## Introspection Limitations
- Security implications: It is recommended to turn off introspection in production
- Performance Consideration
- Versioning Challenges: Issues with managing different schema versions.
