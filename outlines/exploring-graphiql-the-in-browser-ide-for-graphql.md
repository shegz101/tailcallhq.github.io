# Exploring GraphiQL: The In-Browser IDE for GraphQL

**Target Audience:** This article is for all developers and testers who integrate or test GraphQL APIs, whether front-end developers, back-end developers, or QA testers. It's also for anyone else interested in the world of GraphQL APIs.

**Aim:** This article aims to provide developers with an in-depth understanding of GraphiQL, its features, and how to effectively use it to interact with GraphQL APIs. It will cover the fundamentals, and practical applications for utilizing GraphiQL as an in-browser IDE for GraphQL.

## Introduction
Why waste time and effort troubleshooting your GraphQL API directly in your application when there's a more efficient way? Imagine testing and perfecting your queries outside your app, ensuring they work flawlessly before implementation. Sounds ideal, right? With [GraphiQL](https://az.dev/swapi-graphql), you're saving time and gaining control over your development process, empowering you to work more confidently and effectively.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you need:
* Fundamental understanding of GraphQL 
* Basic knowledge of schemas, queries, mutations, and resolvers. 
* A web browser
* A GraphQL API endpoint: This is how GraphiQL can communicate with a server to access the data. 

## What is GraphiQL?
* Definition and overview of GraphiQL

## Why use GraphiQL?
* Advantages/benefits of using GraphiQL (things like Improving your request, validating your improvements, and easily debugging requests running into problems)

## Methods for accessing GraphiQL
To access GraphiQL, you are not limited to the default in-browser method. 
* Head to [https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql](https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql) by querying your search engine (browser) to access the GraphiQL online editor, which works with the Star Wars data, and it is publicly available for you to use
* If you are using Gatsby, you can start the Gatsby development server by pasting this: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` into your browser
* Using Shopify via the [Shopify GraphiQl app](https://shopify-graphiql-app.shopifycloud.com/login)
* Using your own API endpoint: just type your GraphQL server endpoint URL into your browser

## Getting Started with the GraphiQL
* Configuring GraphiQL
* Connecting GraphiQL to your GraphQL server

## Exploring the GraphiQL Interface
* Exploring the GraphiQL interface and understanding the functions of the various panes. The application is two-pane by default, but it becomes three when we access the Documentation Explorer.
* Explain each of the main parts in the GraphiQL interface: Query Editor, Variables Editor, Response pane, and Documentation Explorer.

## Key Features and Capabilities of GraphiQl
Explain the various core features that GraphiQL provides.
* Type-ahead and Auto Completion feature that is aware of the GraphQL type schema you are currently exploring. In addition, explain Context-awareness.
* Live syntax and validation error highlighting.
* Query history
* Fragments: This feature helps us maintain the Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY) pattern when dealing with repetitive code in our query. Instead, you can easily merge fragments into a query.
* Documentation: GraphiQL generates documentation for your schema, making it easy to understand and explore.

## Testing out the Interface
Writing and executing Queries, mutations and Subscriptions
* Writing the query
* Integrating Variables with Your Query
* Utilising fragments to aid query construction
* Executing/Testing the query: Sending requests and handling responses
